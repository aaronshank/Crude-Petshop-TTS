## This will be 2 homeworks combined into one

## Setting Up :
* `npm install`
* `npm install react-router-dom`
* `npm install bootstrap5`

## Starting Application :
* `npm start`

The only functionality on the 'Login' page is the button which will redirect to the PetShop.

## Homework 1: React Router
1. Now that you have run through setting up React Router, take one of your existing React applications and build in this functionality.
2. As an added challenge, try to implenent the Bootstrap NavBar using React Router!

## Homework 2: Bonus: React Router
* Now that you have built-in this functionality on an existing page, you can now do the same thing for another page.
* This time figure out how to do a login with the router. You can omit security checks, but have the page go from one to another.

## Note from Aaron :
* This is a very crude application.
* It is literally notes from class, added a 'Login' page and a Navbar.
* The only other thing I added was some CSS to style around the Navbar and make it look a bit better.
